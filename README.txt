Table of Contents:
Chapter 1: Fundamentals 
	introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. 
	It also includes our programming model.
Chapter 2: Sorting 
	considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort.
	 It also includes a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
Chapter 3: Searching 
	describes several classic symbol table implementations, including binary search trees, red-black 
	trees, and hash tables.
Chapter 4: Graphs 
	surveys the most important graph processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first 
	search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
Chapter 5: Strings 
	investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, 
	substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.
Chapter 6: Context 
	highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, 
	operations research, and intractability.
